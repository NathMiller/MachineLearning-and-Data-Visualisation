Anomaly Detection:
  Scans the dataset for any outliers and prunes them in order for further analysis to take place.

Data Imputation:
  Scans the dataset for missing values and tries different methods to accurately predict what these values may have been based on pre-existing data.

Machine Learning:
  Splits the data into testing and training data to try and train an algorithm to predict values from the dataset, and then comparing them against the real data and scoring it appropriately.

Image Procesing (UNFINISHED):
  Training an AI to recogonise images of different classes (cars, cats, birds, etc.) and attemtping to refine it over multiple epochs. 

Data Visualisation:
  Taking a dataset and displaying its data in various plots in order to gain a better understanding of the data.
